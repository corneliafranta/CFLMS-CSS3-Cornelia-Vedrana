                            Ada was the daughter of famed poet Lord Byron, Augusta Ada Byron, Countess of Lovelace —
                            better
                            known as "Ada Lovelace" — showed her gift for mathematics at an early age. She translated
                            an article on an invention by Charles Babbage, and added her own comments. Because she
                            introduced many computer concepts, Lovelace is considered the first computer programmer.
                            She died on November 27, 1852.
                        </p>

                        <p>Around the age of 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor.
                            The pair became friends, and the much older Babbage served as a mentor to Ada.
                            Through Babbage, Ada began studying advanced mathematics with University of London
                            professor Augustus de Morgan.
                        </p>

                        <p>Ada was fascinated by Babbage's ideas. Known as the father of the computer, he invented
                            the difference engine, which was meant to perform mathematical calculations. Ada got a
                            chance to look at the machine before it was finished, and was captivated by it. Babbage
                            also created plans for another device known as the analytical engine, designed to handle
                            more complex calculations.
                        </p>

                        <p>Ada was later asked to translate an article on Babbage's analytical engine that had been
                            written by Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea for a Swiss journal. She not only
                            translated the original French text into English but <a href=""></a>lso added her own
                            thoughts and
                            ideas on the machine. Her notes ended up being three times longer than the original
                            article. Her work was published in 1843, in an English science journal. Ada used only
                            the initials "A.A.L.," for Augusta Ada Lovelace, in the publication.
